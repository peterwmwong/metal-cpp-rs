A failed attempt to generate Rust bindings for the Apple Metal API

Currently, the bindings don't seem to be good enough to actually use.
- `ApplicationDelegate`'s vtable isn't filled out to even open a window.

Directories [metal-cpp/](./metal-cpp/) and [metal-cpp-extensions/](./metal-cpp-extensions/) are copied (with one exception noted below)
from [Learn Metal with C++](https://developer.apple.com/metal/sample-code/?q=Learn%20Metal%20with%20C)
sample code.

`NS_Defines.hpp` has been modified to disable `_NS_INLINE`, which prevented methods/functions from
being included in the static library used by the bindings generated by Bindgen.

# Build

```sh
# Install master branch build of rust-bindgen that includes `vtable-generation`
cargo install --git https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen --branch master bindgen

# Build/Run
cargo run
```

# Overall approach

1. Generate Rust bindings using Bindgen (see [gen-metal-cpp-rs-bindings.sh](gen-metal-cpp-rs-bindings.sh)),
   output is included in source [metal_cpp_rs_bindings.rs](src/metal_cpp_rs_bindings.rs).
2. Using a [build.rs](./build.rs)....
   1. Create a static library (`metal_cpp_rs_bindings.o`) from [metal_cpp_rs_bindings.cpp](src/metal_cpp_rs_bindings.cpp), which
       only includes the necessary header files from `metal-cpp` and `metal-cpp-extensions`.
   2. Create an archive `libmetal_cpp_rs_bindings.a`
   3. Emit Cargo directives to the compiler to link against `libmetal_cpp_rs_bindings.a` and
       necessary frameworks (`Foundation`, `Cocoa`, `CoreGraphics`, `Metal`, `MetalKit`).
